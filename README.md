## Overview

I created this project using Front End Mentor's social-links-profile challenge as a starting point, but instead of recreating their design exactly, I used my own links/profile photo to make it my own.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Ahsan Tariq Social Links](https://ahsanwritescode.github.io/social-links-profile/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla MDN Web Docs]([https://www.example.com](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - The Mozilla MDN Web Docs were a highly useful resource for understanding CSS Flexboxes, the width property, and the box-sizing property, among others.
